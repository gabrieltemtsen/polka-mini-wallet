# Polka Nano Wallet

## Overview

Polka Nano Wallet is a decentralized application (dApp) inspired by the Front-end Development Basics & Backend Authentication workshop conducted by Jonathan Dune from the Talisman team. The workshop demonstrated how to build a dApp that connects to the Talisman wallet and performs token burns on the Westend Polkadot testnet using RPCs. Building upon this foundation, Polka Nano Wallet aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing Polkadot accounts and sending tokens on the Westend testnet.

## Features

- **Account Management**: View connected Polkadot accounts and their balances.
- **Token Transfer**: Send tokens from one account to another on the Westend testnet.
- **Integration with Talisman Wallet**: Utilize authentication mechanisms demonstrated in the workshop to securely connect to the Talisman wallet.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Polkadot.js API for interacting with the Polkadot network
- **Authentication**: Integration with Talisman wallet authentication mechanisms
- **Deployment**: deployed using Vercel
- **Live Demo**: [Polka-Nano-Wallet](https://polka-nano-wallet.vercel.app)



## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gabrieltemtsen/polka-nano-wallet.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Connect your Talisman wallet to the dApp.
2. View your connected Polkadot accounts and their balances.
3. Send tokens to other addresses on the Westend testnet.

## Roadmap

- Implement additional security features such as multi-factor authentication.
- Enhance user interface and experience based on user feedback.
- Integrate with other Polkadot ecosystem projects for expanded functionality.
- Looking at Mainnet and more possibilities to come.
